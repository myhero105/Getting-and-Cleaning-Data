Course Project: 
Getting and Cleaning Data

Data Description:
The detailed description of the data can be found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The database contains human activity recognition data built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing 
activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been 
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 
70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity.
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was 
used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Description of variables:
There were following varaibles used in completing this project:
  1.Varaibles downloaded from the train and test files were x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test.
  2.Variable x_data and y_data were created to merge the train and test data set to carry out the required analysis.
  3.x_data_mean_and_std_features is a numeric vector that extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
  each measurement
  4.Activity variable uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  5.singleDataSet combines all data sets into one and creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
  variable for each activity and each subject
  
  Description of the function of script:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject.
